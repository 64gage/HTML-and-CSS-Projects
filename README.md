# HTML and CSS Projects
 This is a display of sample websites that I made using HTML and CSS
 
## Projects
+ [Space Station Site](project/index2.html)
+ [My Portfolio](https//:64gage.github.io)
+ [Movie Theatre Site](bootstrap4_project/academy_cinemas.html)

### Space Station Site
This page is an example home page for a Space travel company, except instead of using space images I used images of my favorite One Piece character, zoro. It's styled using CSS and contains a navbar, image containers, and a form.

### My Portfolio
This is my portfolio page. It is styled using CSS and contains an animated sticky navbar, looping background video, 2 column styling, header and paragraph text animations, and a form.

### Movie Theater Site
This page is an example home page for a Movie theater that is styled using Bootstrap 4. It contains many Bootstrap components including but not limited to a navbar, jumbotron, form, cards, and dropdowns.
